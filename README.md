# EnergyStarPrediction  
This is a Project for my Machine Learning Project.  
We want to build a model that can predict the Energy Star Score of a building and interpret the result to find the factors which influence the score most.  
  
What is a correlation coefficient?  
how well they are related.  
PPMC Pearson Product Momoent Correlation  
it show the linear relationship between two sets of data
